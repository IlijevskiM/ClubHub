## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This application is a club management platform designed to help school club organizations efficiently track and manage their activities. 
It allows users to create and maintain club organization profiles, manage club members, and track events attended by members along with the hours they have accumulated. 
Additionally, the app provides a communication system where club members and leaders can engage through posts and comments, visible only to those who have joined the specific clubs. 
To power this functionality, the app utilizes AWS Amplify, leveraging DynamoDB for efficient data storage, Cognito for secure authentication and user management, and S3 for scalable media storage.
